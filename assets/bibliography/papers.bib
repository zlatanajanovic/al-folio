  abstract = {This chapter studies energy efficient driving of (semi)autonomous electric vehicles operating in a dynamic environment with other traffic participants on a unidirectional, multi-lane road. This scenario is considered to be a so called hard problem, as constraints imposed are varying in time and space. Neglecting the constraints imposed from the surrounding traffic, the generation of an energy optimal speed trajectory may lead to bad results, with the risk of low driver acceptance when applied in a real driving environment. An existing approach satisfies constraints from surrounding traffic by modifying an existing unconstrained trajectory. In contrast to this, the proposed approach incorporates a leading vehicle's motion as constraint in order to generate a new optimal speed trajectory in a global optimal sense. First simulation results show that energy optimal driving considering other vehicle participants is important. Even in simple setups significantly (8\%) less energy is consumed at only 1.3\% travelling time prolongation compared to the best constant speed driving strategy. Additionally, the proposed driving strategy is using 4.5\% less energy and leads to 1.6\% shorter travelling time compared to the existing overtaking approach. Using simulation studies, the proposed energy optimal driving strategy is analyzed in different scenarios.},

  abstract = {Predictive motion planning is a key for achieving energy-efficient driving, which is one of the major visions of automated driving nowadays. Motion planning is a challenging task, especially in the presence of other dynamic traffic participants. Two main issues have to be addressed. First, for globally optimal driving, the entire trip has to be considered at once. Second, the movement of other traffic participants is usually not known in advance. Both issues lead to increased computational effort. The length of the prediction horizon is usually large and the problem of unknown future movement of other traffic participants usually requires frequent replanning. This work proposes a novel motion planning approach for vehicles operating in dynamic environments. The above-mentioned problems are addressed by splitting the planning into a strategic planning part and situation-dependent replanning part. Strategic planning is done without considering other dynamic participants and is reused later in order to lower the computational effort during replanning phase.},

Previous work considered search-based optimal motion planning framework (SBOMP) that utilized numerical or model-based heuristics that did not consider dynamic obstacles. Optimal solution was still guaranteed since dynamic obstacles can only increase the cost. However, significant variations in the search efficiency are observed depending whether dynamic obstacles are present or not. This paper introduces machine learning (ML) based heuristic that takes into account dynamic obstacles, thus adding to the performance consistency for achieving real-time implementation.},

The framework allows for real-time computation even for horizons of several hundred meters and thus enabling automated driving in urban conditions. This is achieved through several features. Firstly, a convenient geometrical representation of both the search space and driving constraints enables the use of classical path planning approach. Thus, a wide variety of constraints can be tackled simultaneously (other vehicles, traffic lights, etc.). Secondly, an exact cost-to-go map, obtained by solving a relaxed problem, is then used by A*-based algorithm with model predictive flavour in order to compute the optimal motion trajectory. The algorithm takes into account both distance and time horizons. The approach is validated within a simulation study with realistic traffic scenarios. We demonstrate the capability of the algorithm to devise plans both in fast and slow driving conditions, even when full stop is required.},

  abstract = {Planning and Learning are complementary approaches. Planning relies on deliberative reasoning about the current state and sequence of future reachable states to solve the problem. Learning, on the other hand, is focused on improving system performance based on experience or available data. Learning to improve the performance of planning based on experience in similar, previously solved problems, is ongoing research. One approach is to learn Value function (cost-to-go) which can be used as heuristics for speeding up search-based planning. Existing approaches in this direction use the results of the previous search for learning the heuristics. In this work, we present a search-inspired approach of systematic model exploration for the learning of the value function which does not stop when a plan is available but rather prolongs search such that not only resulting optimal path is used but also extended region around the optimal path. This, in turn, improves both the efficiency and robustness of successive planning. Additionally, the effect of losing admissibility by using ML heuristic is managed by bounding ML with other admissible heuristics.},

Third, human and automated driving trajectories are reproduced and compared in the real vehicle on an empty track without traffic.

  abstract = {To achieve optimal robot behavior in dynamic scenarios we need to consider complex dynamics in a predictive manner. In the vehicle dynamics community, it is well know that to achieve time-optimal driving on low friction surface, the vehicle should utilize drifting. Hence, many authors have devised rules to split circuits and employ drifting on some segments. These rules are suboptimal and do not generalize to arbitrary circuit shapes (e.g., S-like curves). So, the question ``When to go into which mode and how to drive in it?'' remains unanswered. To choose the suitable mode (discrete decision), the algorithm needs information about the feasibility of different modes (continuous motion). This makes it a class of Task and Motion Planning (TAMP) problems, which are known to be hard to solve optimally in real-time. In the AI planning community, search methods are commonly used. However, they cannot be directly applied to TAMP problems due to the continuous component. Here, we present a search-based method that effectively solves this problem and efficiently searches in a highly dimensional state space with nonlinear and unstable dynamics. The space of the possible trajectories is explored by sampling different combinations of motion primitives guided by the search. Our approach allows to use multiple locally approximated models to generate motion primitives (e.g., learned models of drifting) and effectively simplify the problem without losing accuracy. The algorithm performance is evaluated in simulated driving on a mixed-track with segments of different curvatures (right and left). Our code is available at https://git.io/JenvB.},

Simultaneously, increase sample pertinence and improve sampling efficiency. To generate a coarse trajectory in the Cartesian-time coordinate system, we utilize a method based on Informed RRT*. However, owing to the random nature of the sample-based method, the quality of the solution is dependent on the density of the sample. When the sampling density setting is low, the solution is not practicable or has no solution, and when the setting is high, dimension curse may occur. A function to identify barriers ahead of the vehicle is implemented before sampling to mitigate the impact of this flaw on online planning in extreme situations such as cornering and U-turn. We also sample the endpoint and circle the whole sampling region before planning for this task. As a result, the algorithm becomes more targeted. We used B-spline to refine the initial trajectory after acquiring it. The reliability of this method is demonstrated by a real-world vehicle experiment.},

It generalizes the navigation function methodology from static sphere world environments, to dynamic ones. Specifically, it allows the obstacles' locations to be time-varying, albeit unknown, and accommodates the case where the navigation goal is not a single isolated point, but rather a spherical manifold. For such cases, the paper presents analytical bounds on the tuning parameters that guarantee the navigation function properties of the time-varying potential function, uniformly in time. Thus using the same choice of tuning parameters, the agent is ensured that at every instance in time, the artificial potential field that directs it to its destination is free of local minima. The parameter bounds naturally depend on the geometry of the agent workspace, and include conditions on how close the obstacles can approach each other, the fixed workspace boundary, and the destination sphere. The bounds presented here are conservative; their analytic determination serves mainly the purpose of theoretically guaranteeing completeness properties for the methodology in the time-varying obstacle case.},

Then the physical and logical structure of the environment is used to construct a uniform sampling space along the reference, in which a feasible trajectory is grown by numerous incremental sampling points. Finally, a smooth trajectory that meets kinematic constraints in the dynamic and uncertain environment is efficiently generated by use of forward simulation of the vehicle-controller system. In this paper, both the safety and comfort are considered to meet the driving experience, and a recursive function is used to make the trajectory search easier and faster. The proposed motion planner is implemented and tested on a real unmanned vehicle in three different scenarios, and the results show that the framework can output high-quality trajectories to guide the vehicle to its destination safely.},

  abstract = {Real-time kinodynamic trajectory planning in dy-namic environments is critical yet challenging for autonomous driving. In this paper, we propose an efficient trajectory plan-ning system for autonomous driving in complex dynamic sce-narios through iterative and incremental path-speed optimization. Exploiting the decoupled structure of the planning prob-lem, a path planner based on Gaussian process first generates a continuous arc-length parameterized path in the Fren\'et frame, considering static obstacle avoidance and curvature constraints. We theoretically prove that it is a good generalization of the well-known jerk optimal solution. An efficient s-t graph search method is introduced to find a speed profile along the generated path to deal with dynamic environments. Finally, the path and speed are optimized incrementally and iteratively to ensure kinodynamic feasibility. Various simulated scenarios with both static obstacles and dynamic agents verify the effectiveness and robustness of our proposed method. Experimental results show that our method can run at 20 Hz. The source code is released as an open-source package.},

Through combining a high-level route planner that searches for collision-free routes given traffic and obstacle information and a low level motion planner that considers vehicle dynamics, our approach generates smooth trajectories with reasonable parking behaviors rapidly with very low memory consumption. This hierarchical approach allows for online path repairing and replanning when newly detected obstacles that were not indicated on the offline map obstruct the original planned trajectory. It employs a fast clearance checking procedure to obtain a practical indicator of repairability as well as heuristic guidance for rapid trajectory repairing, and utilizes the high-level route planner to conduct real-time replanning when trajectory repairing is deemed to be difficult. Performance analysis on parking tasks in simulation environments demonstrates the advantages of the proposed approach in terms of both trajectory quality and planning time.},

  abstract = {Planning safe trajectories for autonomous vehicles in complex urban environments is challenging since there are numerous semantic elements (such as dynamic agents, traffic lights, and speed limits) to consider. These semantic elements may have different mathematical descriptions, such as obstacle, constraint, and cost. It is non-trivial to tune the effects from different combinations of semantic elements for a stable and generalizable behavior. In this letter, we propose a novel unified spatio-temporal semantic corridor (SSC) structure, which provides a level of abstraction for different types of semantic elements. The SSC consists of a series of mutually connected collision-free cubes with dynamical constraints posed by the semantic elements in the spatio-temporal domain. The trajectory generation problem then boils down to a general quadratic programming formulation. Thanks to the unified SSC representation, our framework can generalize to any combination of semantic elements. Moreover, our formulation provides a theoretical guarantee that the entire trajectory is safe and constraint-satisfied, by using the convex hull and hodograph properties of piecewise B\'ezier curve parameterization. We also release the code of our method to accommodate benchmarking.},

EPSILON is an efficient interaction-aware planning system for automated driving, and is extensively validated in both simulation and real-world dense city traffic. It follows a hierarchical structure with an interactive behavior planning layer and an optimization-based motion planning layer. The behavior planning is formulated from a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), but is much more efficient than naively applying a POMDP to the decision-making problem. The key to efficiency is guided branching in both the action space and observation space, which decomposes the original problem into a limited number of closed-loop policy evaluations. Moreover, we introduce a new driver model with a safety mechanism to overcome the risk induced by the potential imperfectness of prior knowledge. For motion planning, we employ a spatio-temporal semantic corridor (SSC) to model the constraints posed by complex driving environments in a unified way. Based on the SSC, a safe and smooth trajectory is optimized, complying with the decision provided by the behavior planner. We validate our planning system in both simulations and real-world dense traffic, and the experimental results show that our EPSILON achieves human-like driving behaviors in highly interactive traffic flow smoothly and safely without being overconservative compared to the existing planning methods.},

Satisfaction cannot be incorporated in a planning component without proper formalization, nor can it be monitored and verified during simulation or testing. However, no research work has provided a consistent set of machine-interpretable traffic rules for a given operational driving domain. In this paper, we propose a methodology for the legal study and formalization of traffic rules in a formal language. We use Linear Temporal Logic as a formal specification language to describe temporal behaviors, capable of capturing a wide range of traffic rules.

The developed system aims to address the industrial level-4 motion planning problem while considering safety, comfort and scalability. The system covers multilane and single-lane autonomous driving in a hierarchical manner: (1) The top layer of the system is a multilane strategy that handles lane-change scenarios by comparing lane-level trajectories computed in parallel. (2) Inside the lane-level trajectory generator, it iteratively solves path and speed optimization based on a Frenet frame. (3) For path and speed optimization, a combination of dynamic programming and spline-based quadratic programming is proposed to construct a scalable and easy-to-tune framework to handle traffic rules, obstacle decisions and smoothness simultaneously. The planner is scalable to both highway and lower-speed city driving scenarios. We also demonstrate the algorithm through scenario illustrations and on-road test results. The system described in this manuscript has been deployed to dozens of Baidu Apollo autonomous driving vehicles since Apollo v1.5 was announced in September 2017. As of May 16th, 2018, the system has been tested under 3,380 hours and approximately 68,000 kilometers (42,253 miles) of closed-loop autonomous driving under various urban scenarios.

For ego-vehicle driving on structured roads, behavioral decisions tend to pay more attention to the relative distribution of its surrounding vehicles, while path planning based on the decision requires more detailed consideration of vehicle model and lane curvature. Therefore, these two modules are separated in our article and executed successively in different coordinate systems. Specifically, we create a decision topology for lane changing or following decision based on spatio-temporal lane-change gaps in relative moving coordinate, which consists of the node representing the gap and the edges representing the connectivity between two gaps. Combining the decision topology with the behaviors of surrounding dynamic vehicles, a local cost map is generated and the target decision gap is selected. Once the decision is done, a smooth and safe trajectory from the ego-vehicle to the target decision gap, that satisfies the constraints of acceleration and curvature, is obtained in the geodetic coordinate through polynomial trajectory generation. The real-time performance and effectiveness of this method were verified in the dynamic high-speed interaction scenarios.},

We show minimizing aerodynamic drag can maximize utilization of energy available at the wheel and requires low and constant speeds. By employing optimal control theory we show periods of maximal acceleration, maximal braking, and coasting often accompany constant speed cruising to satisfy boundary conditions on the states (bang-singular-bang optimal control). In the case of gasoline engine vehicles, analytical optimal control derivations show that pulse and glide operation of the engine while cruising can further reduce fuel use (chattering optimal control). For electric vehicles (EV), quadratic rather than linear dependence of energy use on control input results in different eco-driving patterns from gasoline engine vehicles. For EVs, analytical solution to the two point boundary value optimal control problem could be obtained after model simplification which is compared to numerical solution based on a more accurate model. We also evaluate optimal control solution in the presence of state constraints for EVs. Several simulation case studies are presented to showcase the energy efficiency gains with proposed eco driving strategies.},

The neural networks are trained with supervised learning techniques to predict the future state of the vehicle based on its current state and driving inputs. Learning data is provided for a wide variety of randomly generated driving scenarios by simulation of a dynamic vehicle model. The realistic random driving maneuvers are created on the basis of piecewise linear travel velocity and road curvature profiles that are used for the planning of public roads. The trained neural networks are then used in a feedback loop with several variables being calculated by additional numerical integration to provide all the outputs of the original dynamic model. The presented model can be capable of short-term vehicle motion simulation with sufficient precision while having a considerably faster runtime than the original dynamic model.},

The intent recognition algorithm predicts the probabilistic hybrid motion states of each agent vehicle over a finite horizon using Bayesian filtering and a library of pre-learned maneuver motion models. We update the POMDP model with the intent recognition results in real time and solve it using a heuristic search algorithm which produces policies with upper-bound guarantees on the probability of near colliding with other dynamic agents. We demonstrate that our system is able to generate better motion plans in terms of efficiency and safety in a number of challenging environments including unprotected intersection left turns and lane changes as compared to the baseline methods.},

However, regardless of the changes occurring in traffic scenes, the current local path planning frameworks of ADSs are based on the fixed frequency re-planning path (i.e., running their planning algorithms repeatedly). This planning method makes it difficult to provide a reasonable traveling path, agility, and comfort for driverless vehicles in changing traffic scenarios. Therefore, this article performs an in-depth analysis of the problems of traditional planning frameworks which use a fixed frequency to replan the path and proposes a novel path planning framework that is universal based on multiple-models. The proposed framework divides the planning process into several layers, each of which has different functions. With this framework, the ADS can adaptively adjust the planning process according to the changes in traffic scenes and then provide different path planning algorithms to ensure its safety and flexibility in the process of driving. Moreover, the problems caused by the traditional planning framework can be solved. This framework has been applied to the autonomous vehicle ``Pioneer'', which won first place in the 2019 China Intelligent Vehicle Future Challenge (IVFC). The effectiveness and rationality of the integrated framework of local path planning proposed in this article were verified by a large number of tests in real-world traffic scenarios.},

The motivation is that original sensor data is not always necessary for tasks such as planning and control when semantic perception results are ready, so that simulating perception directly is more economic and efficient. In this work, a series of evaluation methods such as matching metric and performance of downstream task are exploited to examine the simulation quality. Experiments show that our method is effective to model the behavior of learning-based perception model, and can be further applied in the proposed simulation route smoothly.},

This work aims to obtain a method for machine-learning-based driving environment classification that does not involve computer vision but instead makes use of dynamics variables from Inertial-Measurement-Unit (IMU) sensors and instantaneous energy consumption measurements. This article includes details about the data acquisition, the electric vehicle used for the experiments, and the pre-processing methods employed. This explores the viability of a method for classifying a vehicle's driving environment. The results of such a system can potentially be used to provide precise information for path planning, energy optimization, or safety purposes. Information about the driving context could be also used to decide if the conditions are safe for autonomous driving or if human intervention is recommended or required. In this work, the feature selection process and statistical data pre-processing methods are evaluated. The pre-processed data are used to compare 13 different classification algorithms and then the best three are selected for further testing and data dimensionality reduction. Two approaches for feature selection based on feature importance and final classification scores are tested, achieving a classification mean accuracy of 93 percent with a real testing dataset that included three driving scenarios and eight different drivers. The obtained results and high classification accuracy represent a first approach for the further development of such classification systems and the potential for direct implementation into autonomous driving technology.},

  abstract = {Historically, robots have successfully performed various tasks in isolated areas by following preprogrammed commands. However, more and more potential robotic applications require robots to complete tasks alongside or in collaboration with other agents such as other robots and human workers. Such robots need algorithms that enable flexible behaviors in crowded and uncertain environments, e.g., to plan actions safely and efficiently in shared spaces where other agents are present. Consequently, researchers have proposed modularized robotic systems, which typically consist of perception, prediction, planning, and control modules. However, most of these works only emphasize the design of a single module and use off-the-shelf methods directly for other modules. Therefore, the improvements made by the re-designed module may have limited value to the overall robotic system; the off-the-shelf methods may not be able to provide adequate information or fully utilize the information provided by the re-designed module. Robot modules should be designed for better performance individually and collectively; thus, this dissertation aims to develop integrated designs and strategies for modularized robotic systems in uncertain environments. Furthermore, the computational efficiency of the robotic system is crucial to the robot's performance in uncertain environments; we address the improvement of the computational speed of the most time-consuming module, the planner. This dissertation consists of two parts. Part I involves a fundamental exploration of robot motion planners and proposes hybrid motion planners that combine and utilize different planning methods for better computational speed and plan quality, such as travel distance. Chapter 2 combines a sampling-based algorithm, RRT*, and an optimization-based algorithm, the convex feasible set algorithm (CFS). Chapter 3 focuses on long-horizon planning problems; it combines RRT*, CFS, the Interior Point OPTimizer, and segmented trajectory optimization. Chapter 4 focuses on motion planning for articulated vehicles; it combines a search-based algorithm, improved A-search guided tree, and utilizes results from reinforcement learning to guide the search. Simulation results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed motion planners in terms of computational speed and plan quality in static and deterministic environments cluttered with obstacles. Chapter 5 studies motion planning in dynamic environments and presents a hierarchical receding horizon control (HRHC) framework. The HRHC coordinates a motion planner, such as the planners presented in Chapters 2-4, with a safety controller to achieve safe and efficient robot motion in uncertain environments in simulations and real-world experiments.Part II presents application-oriented integrated robotic systems that coordinate the predictor and the planner to make an effective and safe plan. Chapter 6 discusses the close relationship between the prediction and planning modules and identifies several conditions for realizing safe model predictive control in dynamic and uncertain environments; we present a predictor designed for better closed-loop robot performance. Simulations and real-world experiments that involve a robot working alongside a human worker are conducted; the robot can navigate safely in the presence of unexpected human movements. In Chapter 7, simulations with a computer assembly setting that involve a robot collaborating with a human worker are conducted; the proposed robotic system coordinates the prediction and planning modules to utilize human motion prediction and uncertainty estimation for robust task planning. The robot can generate time-efficient task plans when the human worker performs inefficiently. In Chapter 8, simulations involving an autonomous vehicle navigating in a parking lot while avoiding collisions with static and moving obstacles are conducted; the proposed system includes a hybrid environment predictor that makes short-term and long-term predictions of the surroundings and a strategic motion planner that reacts to the environment according to the predictions. The robot demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of motion prediction, safe tracking, retreating in an emergency, and trajectory repairing.},

A multimodal hierarchical Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) framework is designed to learn joint driving pattern-intention-motion models from real-world interactive driving trajectory data. Using the learned models, the proposed approach can probabilistically predict the continuous motions partitioned by discrete driving styles and intentions, while taking into account of the interactions between participants' actions. A chance-constrained POMDP strategy is utilized to generate risk-bounded motion plans based on those predictions. Simulation case studies based on challenging scenarios demonstrate that the proposed framework is effective in predicting surrounding vehicles' behaviors and generating safe motion plans in complex traffic environments.},

The prevalent on-road trajectory planners include the spline-based, sample-and-search-based, and optimal-control-based methods. Path-velocity decomposition and Frenet frame have been widely adopted in the aforementioned methods, which, nonetheless, largely degrade the trajectory planning quality when the road curvature is large and/or the scenario is complex. This paper aims to plan precise and high-quality on-road trajectories, thus we choose to describe the concerned scheme as an optimal control problem, wherein the urban road scenario is described completely in the Cartesian frame rather than in the Frenet frame. The formulated optimal control problem should be numerically solved in real-time. To that end, a light-weighted iterative computation architecture is built. In each iteration, a tunnel construction strategy tractablely models the collision-avoidance constraints, and a constraint softening strategy helps to find an intermediate trajectory for constructing the tunnels in the next iteration. Efficacy of the proposed on-road trajectory planner is validated by simulations on a high-curvature urban road wherein the ego vehicle is surrounded by multiple social vehicles at various speeds.},

Among the predominant sampleand-search planners, most of the sampling operations are not flexible, which inevitably lead to a solution failure if the sampling density is low, and suffer from the curse of dimensionality if the sampling density is set high. This work proposes a modified RRT* for trajectory search, aiming to promote the sampling flexibility and to get rid of the search randomness.

However, most of the predominant MP solvers only derive local optima because global optimization takes too long. As the predominant MP solvers only find local optima, the solution quality relies on the homotopy class of the initial guess, i.e. the starting point of an optimization process. A* search in the abstracted x-y-time state space is adopted to find a suitable initial guess, which directly plans a coarse trajectory rather than a path. With the initial guess, an MP in the form of a quadratically constrained quadratic program (QCQP) is solved easily.

Safety is an essential issue when a vehicle travels on an urban road, especially when blind regions appear in the way ahead. Absent-minded pedestrians may appear suddenly from the blind region at the roadside. Following the predominant first-sampling-then-optimization hierarchical planning framework, this work is focused on how to make the derived trajectory safer w.r.t. the underlying risks in the occlusion areas. In searching for a coarse trajectory via sampling in the time-s-l state space and searching via dynamic programming (DP), we formulate a cost function that can handle occlusion-related risks quantitatively. Through this way, the occluded regions would be treated seriously but not overcautiously. According to the derived simulation results, the ego vehicle tends to go far away from the occluded regions or to slow down, which is intuitively following human drivers' common practice.},

Without a near-feasible or near-optimal initial guess, the NLP-solving process is usually slow. With the purpose of accelerating the NLP solution, a search-based rough planning stage is added to generate appropriate initial guesses. Concretely, a continuous state space is formulated, which consists of Cartesian product of 2D configuration space and a time dimension. The rough trajectory is generated by a graph-search based planner, namely the A* algorithm. Herein, the nodes in the graph are constructed by discretizing the aforementioned continuous spatio-temporal space.

  abstract = {Maneuver decision-making and trajectory planning play important roles in autonomous driving since a safe and flexible decision module is indispensable for navigation. Typical algorithms apply sampling methods to generate feasible trajectories. However, the fixed sampling distance and maneuver execution time in a sampling approach sacrifice the flexibility of algorithm. Moreover, since motion planning can be represented as a high-dimensional problem, it usually results in unnecessary samples that require additional resources to search the solution. Therefore, a semantic-level maneuver sampling and trajectory planning algorithm is proposed to solve the above problems. In the upper-level maneuver decision, the decision-making problem is formulated as a selection of the forward leading object. A semantic-level decision tree is built to sample long-term maneuver sequences, and the safety corridor of each maneuver sequence is calculated according to the surrounding environment. In the lower-level trajectory planning, the process is decoupled into longitudinal and lateral directions. First, a heuristic search method is proposed to generate longitudinal trajectory candidates for each maneuver sequence. Then, an exhaustive search algorithm is employed to synchronously generate the lateral trajectory within safety corridor. Among the generated trajectory candidates, the one with minimum cost will be chosen as the searching result. Furthermore, in order to improve the driving comfort, numerical optimization is adopted to refine the result by accounting for the constraints of kinematics and safety. Finally, the proposed method was evaluated through simulations of typical on-road dynamic scenarios, which help verify its performance with desirable computation efficiency of less than 32 ms.},

  abstract = {We develop a generic mechanism for generating vehicle-type specific sequences of waypoints from a probabilistic foundation model of driving behavior. Many foundation behavior models are trained on data that does not include vehicle information, which limits their utility in downstream applications such as planning. Our novel methodology conditionally specializes such a behavior predictive model to a vehicle-type by utilizing byproducts of the reinforcement learning algorithms used to produce vehicle specific controllers. We show how to compose a vehicle specific value function estimate with a generic probabilistic behavior model to generate vehicle-type specific waypoint sequences that are more likely to be physically plausible then their vehicle-agnostic counterparts.},

  abstract = {Several recent works show impressive results in mapping language-based human commands and image scene observations to direct robot executable policies (e.g., pick and place poses). However, these approaches do not consider the uncertainty of the trained policy and simply always execute actions suggested by the current policy as the most probable ones. This makes them vulnerable to domain shift and inefficient in the number of required demonstrations. We extend previous works and present the PARTNR algorithm that can detect ambiguities in the trained policy by analyzing multiple modalities in the pick and place poses using topological analysis. PARTNR employs an adaptive, sensitivity-based, gating function that decides if additional user demonstrations are required. User demonstrations are aggregated to the dataset and used for subsequent training. In this way, the policy can adapt promptly to domain shift and it can minimize the number of required demonstrations for a well-trained policy. The adaptive threshold enables to achieve the user-acceptable level of ambiguity to execute the policy autonomously and in turn, increase the trustworthiness of our system. We demonstrate the performance of PARTNR in a table-top pick and place task.},

  abstract = {Building self-driving vehicles is exciting and promising. It is going to transform the way we live and provide safety, efficiency, and mobility for everyone. In this thesis, I present a collection of our work in the direction of building smart self-driving vehicles from understanding convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to the full autonomy stacks, including perception, prediction, and planning. First, we study the property of CNNs and provide theoretical analysis on the receptive field. We use Fourier transform and center limit theorem to show that the effective receptive field only occupies a fraction of the theoretical one, especially in deep models. This can provide insights for future CNNs design. Next, we push the state of the art for tasks in the autonomy stacks using deep CNNs. For depth estimation with stereo cameras, we develop a deep matching network that simplifies previous approaches by using a dot-product layer and incorporates a multi-class classification loss, allowing the network to calibrate scores among larger contexts. These greatly improve the runtime and achieve much better matching results. Furthermore, we extend the idea to optical flow where the matching is done in 2D space. Combined with an instance segmentation algorithm, we achieve state-of-the-art results on KITTI optical flow benchmark. Third, we propose new formulations for the self-driving system, i.e. using a joint model for 3D detection, prediction, and tracking. Our model takes a sequence of consecutive LiDAR sweeps and predicts the bounding boxes for vehicles at the current time step as well as one second into the future. Tracking is done by greedily checking the overlap between current detections and predictions from the past. This approach bridges the gap between perception and prediction to achieve better performance both in accuracy and runtime. Then, we take this one step further to construct a deep structured model for interpretable neural motion planning, where the CNN also predicts a 3D cost volume, expanding on time and x-y spatial dimensions. The final planning trajectory is generated with a sampling-based inference algorithm. We conduct offline testing and show that our approach is better than several baselines.},

In the context of DTPI, in this study, we investigate trajectory-prediction-enabled motion planning for autonomous vehicles using deep neural networks. We first implement a motion planner using a neural network as an approximation of traditional planners. The inputs to the baseline planner include the current states of the ego and its surrounding agents and a shared map. The planner produces a five-second trajectory for the ego vehicle considering the current situation. Subsequently, we generalize the baseline to consider the historical states of the ego and its surrounding agents. Using the generalized planner, we investigate the impacts of the history horizon on planning performance. We next investigate how the future motions of the surrounding agents of the ego affect the planner and observe improvement in planning. This demonstrates that knowledge of the future trajectories of other agents is useful for planning. However, we do not have access to ground-truth future motions for inference. Finally, we investigate how the future can be approximated through prediction and how the prediction quality affects planning performance.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes two algorithms for adaptive driving in urban environments: the first uses vision deep learning, which is named the sparse spatial convolutional neural network (SSCNN); and the second uses a sensor integration algorithm, named the sensor-weighted integration field (SWIF). These algorithms utilize three kinds of sensors, namely vision, Light Detection and Range (LiDAR), and GPS sensors, and decide critical motions for autonomous vehicle, such as steering angles and vehicle speed. SSCNN, which is used for lane recognition, has 2.7 times faster processing speed than the existing spatial CNN method. Additionally, the dataset for SSCNN was constructed by considering both normal and abnormal driving in 7 classes. Thus, lanes can be recognized by extending lanes for special characteristics in urban settings, in which the lanes can be obscured or erased, or the vehicle can drive in any direction. SWIF generates a two-dimensional matrix, in which elements are weighted by integrating both the object data from LiDAR and waypoints from GPS based on detected lanes. These weights are the integers, indicating the degree of safety. Based on the field formed by SWIF, the safe trajectories for two vehicles' motions, steering angles, and vehicle speed are generated by applying the cost field. Additionally, to flexibly follow the desired steering angle and vehicle speed, the Proportional-Integral-Differential (PID) control is moderated by an integral anti-windup scheme. Consequently, as the dataset considers characteristics of the urban environment, SSCNN is able to be adopted for lane recognition on urban roads. The SWIF algorithm is also useful for flexible driving owing to the high efficiency of its sensor integration, including having a resolution of 2 cm per pixel and speed of 24 fps. Thus, a vehicle can be successfully maneuvered with minimized steering angle change, without lane or route departure, and without obstacle collision in the presence of diverse disturbances in urban road conditions.},

The framework enables real-time computation by progressively shrinking the solution space. First, a graph searcher based on combined heuristic and partial motion planning is proposed for finding coarse trajectories in spatiotemporal space. To enable fast online planning, a time interval-based algorithm that considers obstacle prediction trajectories is proposed, which uses line segment intersection detection to check for collisions. Second, to practically smooth the coarse trajectory, a continuous optimizer is implemented in three layers, corresponding to the whole path, the near-future path and the speed profile. We use discrete points to represent the far-future path and parametric curves to represent the near-future path and the whole speed profile. The approach is validated in both simulations and real-world off-road environments based on representative scenarios, including the ``wait and go'' scenario. The experimental results show that the proposed method improves the success rate and travel efficiency while actively avoiding static and moving obstacles.},

  abstract = {The motion planners used in self-driving vehicles need to generate trajectories that are safe, comfortable, and obey the traffic rules. This is usually achieved by two modules: behavior planner, which handles high-level decisions and produces a coarse trajectory, and trajectory planner that generates a smooth, feasible trajectory for the duration of the planning horizon. These planners, however, are typically developed separately, and changes in the behavior planner might affect the trajectory planner in unexpected ways. Furthermore, the final trajectory outputted by the trajectory planner might differ significantly from the one generated by the behavior planner, as they do not share the same objective. In this paper, we propose a jointly learnable behavior and trajectory planner. Unlike most existing learnable motion planners that address either only behavior planning, or use an uninterpretable neural network to represent the entire logic from sensors to driving commands, our approach features an interpretable cost function on top of perception, prediction and vehicle dynamics, and a joint learning algorithm that learns a shared cost function employed by our behavior and trajectory components. Experiments on real-world self-driving data demonstrate that jointly learned planner performs significantly better in terms of both similarity to human driving and other safety metrics, compared to baselines that do not adopt joint behavior and trajectory learning.},

  abstract = {Traditional planning and control methods could fail to find a feasible trajectory for an autonomous vehicle to execute amongst dense traffic on roads. This is because the obstacle-free volume in spacetime is very small in these scenarios for the vehicle to drive through. However, that does not mean the task is infeasible since human drivers are known to be able to drive amongst dense traffic by leveraging the cooperativeness of other drivers to open a gap. The traditional methods fail to take into account the fact that the actions taken by an agent affect the behaviour of other vehicles on the road. In this work, we rely on the ability of deep reinforcement learning to implicitly model such interactions and learn a continuous control policy over the action space of an autonomous vehicle. The application we consider requires our agent to negotiate and open a gap in the road in order to successfully merge or change lanes. Our policy learns to repeatedly probe into the target road lane while trying to find a safe spot to move in to. We compare against two model-predictive control-based algorithms and show that our policy outperforms them in simulation. As part of this work, we introduce a benchmark for driving in dense traffic for use by the community.},

  abstract = {It is hard to find the global optimum of general nonlinear and nonconvex optimization problems in a reasonable time. This article presents a method to transfer the receding horizon control approach, where nonlinear, nonconvex optimization problems are considered, into graph-search problems. Specifically, systems with symmetries are considered to transfer system dynamics into a finite-state automaton. In contrast to traditional graph-search approaches where the search continues until the goal vertex is found, the transfer of a receding horizon control approach to graph-search problems presented in this article allows to solve them in real time. We prove that the solutions are recursively feasible by restricting the graph search to end in accepting states of the underlying finite-state automaton. The approach is applied to trajectory planning for multiple networked and autonomous vehicles. We evaluate its effectiveness in simulation and experiments in the Cyber-Physical Mobility Lab, an open-source platform for networked and autonomous vehicles. We show real-time capable trajectory planning with collision avoidance in experiments on off-the-shelf hardware and code in MATLAB for two vehicles.},

First, tests showed significantly deteriorated and unstable performance results of the corresponding controller caused by sensor delays and actuator imperfections. After the diagnosis of the problem, an approach to mitigate these issues was undertaken by predicting the delayed sensor data utilizing a linear Kalman filter and an a priori predictor. The Kalman filter and a priori predictor design approach are based on a discrete time version of the lane-tracking model. The proposed measures are easy to be implemented on real-time hardware due to low computational effort. The approach is described using simulation results and verified with results from a test vehicle in real driving conditions.},

  abstract = {In this work, we address the motion planning problem for autonomous vehicles through a new lattice planning approach, called Feedback Enhanced Lattice Planner (FELP). Existing lattice planners have two major limitations, namely the high dimensionality of the lattice and the lack of modeling of agent vehicle behaviors. We propose to apply the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM) [1] as a speed feedback policy to address both of these limitations. IDM both enables the responsive behavior of the agents, and uniquely determines the acceleration and speed profile of the ego vehicle on a given path. Therefore, only a spatial lattice is needed, while discretization of higher order dimensions is no longer required. Additionally, we propose a directed-graph map representation to support the implementation and execution of lattice planners. The map can reflect local geometric structure, embed the traffic rules adhering to the road, and is efficient to construct and update. We show that FELP is more efficient compared to other existing lattice planners through runtime complexity analysis, and we propose two variants of FELP to further reduce the complexity to polynomial time. We demonstrate the improvement by comparing FELP with an existing spatiotemporal lattice planner using simulations of a merging scenario and continuous highway traffic. We also study the performance of FELP under different traffic densities.},

Current industry-standard solutions use rule-based systems for planning. Although they perform reasonably well in common scenarios, the engineering complexity renders this approach incompatible with human-level performance. On the other hand, the performance of machine-learned (ML) planning solutions can be improved by simply adding more exemplar data. However, ML methods cannot offer safety guarantees and sometimes behave unpredictably. To combat this, our approach uses a simple yet effective rule-based fallback layer that performs sanity checks on an ML planner's decisions (e.g. avoiding collision, assuring physical feasibility). This allows us to leverage ML to handle complex situations while still assuring the safety, reducing ML planner-only collisions by 95\%. We train our ML planner on 300 hours of expert driving demonstrations using imitation learning and deploy it along with the fallback layer in downtown San Francisco, where it takes complete control of a real vehicle and navigates a wide variety of challenging urban driving scenarios.},

Meanwhile, the behavior planning feature is integrated into the path-tracking module. Then, a linear parameter-varying model predictive control is deployed for trajectory tracking of autonomous vehicles and compared with the linear model predictive control method. Finally, the control performance of the proposed approach was evaluated through simulation trials on urban roads with placed obstacles. The outcomes revealed that the suggested framework satisfies the processing rate and high-precision criteria, while safely avoiding obstacles, indicating that it is a promising control strategy for real-world applications.},

It requires the planner to be capable of responding to the changes in driving scenarios in real-time. This paper proposes a hybrid trajectory planning framework by combining the sampling- and numerical optimization-based approaches to cope with the complex driving scenarios. First, a risk field model is introduced to assess the risks with the static and moving obstacles. Then, the sampling-based approach is used to generate collision-free trajectory candidates via the Path Velocity Decomposition method. Thus, the optimal behavior trajectory can be obtained by considering curve smoothness, collision risk, and travel time. The optimization-based method is adopted to optimize the behavior trajectory to guarantee safety, vehicle dynamics stability, and driving comfort using the Sequential Quadratic Programming within the spatio-temporal boundaries. Finally, the proposed framework is examined in typical dynamic driving scenarios through simulation, and the results verify its competency in generating high-quality trajectories in real-time.},

Assuming bounds on speeds of robot destination and obstacles, and sufficiently higher maximum robot speed, the navigation function gradient can be used produce robot feedback laws that guarantee obstacle avoidance, and theoretical guarantees of bounded tracking errors and asymptotic convergence to the target when the latter eventually stops moving. The efficacy of the gradient-based feedback controller derived from the new navigation function construction is demonstrated both in numerical simulations as well as experimentally.},

This dissertation puts forward a novel trajectory planning framework for intelligent vehicles to generate safe and optimal driving trajectories. First, we design a spatiotemporal occupancy framework to deal with all kinds of elements in the complex driving environment based on the Fren\'et frame. This framework unifies various constraints on the road in the three-dimensional spatiotemporal representation and clearly describes the collision-free configuration space. Then we use the convex approximation method to construct a time-varying convex feasible region based on the above accurate temporal and spatial description. We formulate the trajectory planning problem as a standard quadratic programming formulation with collision-free and dynamics constraints. Finally, we apply the iterative convex optimization algorithm to solve the quadratic programming problem in the time-varying convex feasible region. Moreover, we design several typical experimental scenarios and have verified that the proposed method has good effectiveness and real-time.},

  abstract = {Trajectory planning in complex traffic situations has always been a challenging task for intelligent vehicles. Comparing to the decoupling method, the spatio-temporal trajectory planning method owns more flexibility and reasonability due to the combination of lateral and longitudinal motion. However, it still has some shortcomings, such as unreasonable risk assessment, high computational complexity and heavy dependence on other models for generating target points. Therefore, a novel spatio-temporal based trajectory planning framework considering probability risk is proposed in this paper. Firstly, a GNN-LSTM based on trajectory prediction algorithm is presented in terms of risk analysis, and particularly the predicted trajectories and the vehicle dynamic model are combined for risk assessment. Secondly, a rough-fine hierarchical planning framework based on reachable set and dynamic programming is proposed. In this framework, the reachable set is taken as spatio-temporal node to reduce the computational costs and dynamic programming can help the algorithm to eliminate the dependence of other models in evaluating target points. Finally, a traffic scenario with random interactive obstacles is built and tested on a HIL platform. The experimental results show that compared with other typical algorithms, the average driving efficiency, driving risk behavior and driving comfort of the vehicle are significantly improved.},

This paper reviews the current state of the art in mMP, with an exclusive focus on its impact on traffic congestion. The paper identifies the availability of congestion scenarios in current datasets, and summarizes the required features for training mMP. For learning methods, the major methods in both imitation learning and non-imitation learning are surveyed. The emerging technologies adopted by some leading AV companies, such as Tesla, Waymo, and Comma.ai, are also highlighted. It is found that: (i) the AV industry has been mostly focusing on the long tail problem related to safety and has overlooked the impact on traffic congestion, (ii) the current public self-driving datasets have not included enough congestion scenarios, and mostly lack the necessary input features/output labels to train mMP, and (iii) although the reinforcement learning approach can integrate congestion mitigation into the learning goal, the major mMP method adopted by industry is still behavior cloning, whose capability to learn a congestion-mitigating mMP remains to be seen. Based on the review, the study identifies the research gaps in current mMP development. Some suggestions for congestion mitigation for future mMP studies are proposed: (i) enrich data collection to facilitate the congestion learning, (ii) incorporate non-imitation learning methods to combine traffic efficiency into a safety-oriented technical route, and (iii) integrate domain knowledge from the traditional car-following theory to improve the string stability of mMP.},

In this article, a novel planning concept, CarPre trajectory planning, based on Monte-Carlo tree search, is presented. Using a speed-dependent steering angle transformation, the state space of a kinematic single track model is discretized. The planner can then choose between different actions, each consisting of a discrete-value pair of an acceleration and a steering rate. With this, an equitemporal search tree is created to compute the future trajectory. Using Monte-Carlo simulations, the influence of short-term actions of the vehicle can be evaluated over a longer planning horizon. Thus, the current best solution can be accessed at any point during computation, enabling real-time applications. Furthermore, the discretized search tree enables easy checking of complex constraints dependent on binary or continuous variables. The concept is verified on a real test vehicle in a lane keeping maneuver. Through initial testing, a pleasant driving experience is perceived, which indicates future acceptance of the real-time capable algorithm.},

  abstract = {Autonomes Fahren wird die pers\"onliche Mobilit\"at der Zukunft ma\ss geblich ver\"andern. Doch bis diese Vision Wirklichkeit wird, ist noch einige Forschungs- und Entwicklungsarbeit n\"otig. Denn gerade die schwierigsten Verkehrsszenarien, welche insbesondere in st\"adtischen Gebieten auftreten, sind noch oft eine Herausforderung. Der Fokus dieser Arbeit liegt auf der Trajektorienplanung, also der Planung des zuk\"unftigen Fahrtweges in Abh\"angigkeit der Zeit. Diese Planung kann auch als das Kernelement des autonomen Fahrzeugs angesehen werden, da sie alle bisher berechneten Informationen zusammenf\"ugt und daraus die zuk\"unftige Trajektorie bestimmt. Das Planungsergebnis ist au\ss erdem direkt von den Passagieren wahrnehmbar und kann zur Beurteilung des Gesamtsystems herangezogen werden. Somit h\"angt die Akzeptanz sowie das Vertrauen in das autonome Fahrzeug ma\ss geblich vom berechneten Planungsergebnis ab. Die Berechnung eines solchen Planungsergebnisses ist allerdings komplex und muss in Echtzeit gel\"ost werden. In diesem Kontext behandelt diese Dissertation die folgenden Fragen: 1. wie diese rechenintensive Planungsaufgabe vereinfacht werden kann und 2. wie im gesamten Planungsraum effizient eine Trajektorie berechnet werden kann. Hierzu wird zuerst die Wahl des Referenzpunktes, also der Bezugspunkt zwischen einem fahrzeugfesten Koordinatensystem zu einem Weltkoordinatensystem, analysiert. Dieser wird als ideal angenommen, wenn der seitliche Platzbedarf zu beiden Fahrzeugseiten gleich gro\ss{} ist. F\"ur Kurven konstanter Kr\"ummungen wird analytisch die Idealposition hergeleitet. Nach einer Analyse von Kurven mit variablen Kr\"ummungen empfiehlt der Autor den Referenzpunkt auf oder leicht hinter die Vorderachse zu legen. Die bisher theoretischen \"Uberlegungen werden in einer Kollisions\"uberpr\"ufung sowie einer Fahrspurzuordnung in die Praxis \"ubertragen. F\"ur weitere potenzielle Vereinfachungen wird ein Datensatz mit von Menschen gefahrenen Trajektorien analysiert. Dabei wird zuerst untersucht, mit welcher Abtastzeit die Trajektorien durch ein kinematisches Einspurmodell abgebildet werden k\"onnen, bevor geschwindigkeitsabh\"angige Transformationen des Lenkwinkels sowie der Lenkwinkelgeschwindigkeit hergeleitet werden. Basierend auf diesen Transformationen wird ein umgebungsunabh\"angiges Verhaltensmodell pr\"asentiert, welches ein Standardverhalten menschlicher Fahrenden darstellt. In einem n\"achsten Schritt wird ein neuartiges Planungskonzept, die CarPre-Trajektorienplanung, basierend auf der Monte-Carlo Baumsuche vorgestellt. Durch Verwendung der vorher extrahierten Lenkwinkeltransformation wird der Zustandsraum eines kinematischen Einspurmodells diskretisiert. Die wertediskreten Planungsaktionen, bestehend aus Beschleunigungen sowie Lenkwinkelgeschwindigkeiten, werden in einem Suchbaum zur Berechnung der zuk\"unftigen Trajektorie eingesetzt. Zur Kollisions\"uberpr\"ufung sowie Fahrspurzuordnung wird hierbei auf die Referenzpunkt\"uberlegungen zur\"uckgegriffen. Das Konzept wird in einem Spurhalteman\"over sowie einer Ann\"aherung an ein statisches Objekt simulativ verifiziert. Abschlie\ss end wird der Planungsalgorithmus im Rahmen des Projektes PRORETA 5 auf einem prototypischen Fahrzeug analysiert. Durch erste Tests wird ein angenehmer Fahrkomfort festgestellt, welcher auf die zuk\"unftige Akzeptanz des echtzeitf\"ahigen Algorithmus schlie\ss en l\"asst. In einer weiteren Untersuchung werden die praktischen Auswirkungen unterschiedlicher Abtastzeiten innerhalb des Planungsalgorithmus ausgewertet. Durch die Wahl h\"oherer Abtastzeiten wird das exponentielle Wachstum des Planungsproblems verlangsamt. Dies erm\"oglicht z.B. eine Vergr\"o\ss erung des Planungshorizonts, sodass vorausschauender geplant werden kann. Somit leistet diese Dissertation einen Beitrag f\"ur die Trajektorienplanung autonomer Fahrzeuge und erm\"oglicht einen Schritt weiter in die Richtung der Vision des autonomen Fahrens; einen Schritt weiter in die Richtung der Mobilit\"at der Zukunft.},
