Hello,

I am a Postdoctoral Researcher in the Cognitive Robotics Department (CoR), Delft University of Technology (Netherlands) with Prof. Jens Kober. 

Previously, I received a master's degree from the Univesity of Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina) and a PhD degree from the Graz University of Technology (Austria), all focused on Automation and Control. Previously, as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Fellow, I was a senior researcher at VIRTUAL VEHICLE Research GmbH, Graz (Austria), a visiting researcher at TU Delft, University of Sarajevo, AVL List and Volvo Cars.

My main research interest lies in the Decision-making and Control of Autonomous Robots based on Planning, Learning and Control Theory. 

For my work, I recieved the IFAC Young Author Award and Hans List Award (PhD thesis).

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
